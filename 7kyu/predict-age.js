// My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

// In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

// Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
// Multiply each number by itself.
// Add them all together.
// Take the square root of the result.
// Divide by two.

//Solution
function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){
  let arr = [age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8]
  return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(arr.map(a => a * a).reduce((b,c) => b + c)) / 2)
}
