// In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

// Example:
// "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
// "GTAT" --> "CATA"
